## Examples

Please take a look at the example scripts provided to get an idea on how to run and use this package. Each example has a
comment at the top of the script describing the behaviour of the script.

For these example scripts, you need

1. Setup a repository on [GraphDB Free](http://graphdb.ontotext.com/) called `sandbox`. To run any example script you first
   have to launch GraphDB, and then you can run the example script.

1. Install the package from the repository root. It is recommended to do this in a virtual environment:
   ```shell
       > python -m venv examples/venv
       > source examples/venv/bin/activate
       (venv) > pip install .
   ```
   To exit and clean the virtual environment after use, run
   ```shell
       (venv) > deactivate
       > rm -rf examples/venv
   ```

1. Change your current directory to `./examples/`

1. Run some examples (e.g. `python carl.py`)

### Capsules

'Capsules' are the way in which this package expects information for processing. They are `JSON` structures (or `JSON`
-like objects like Python dictionaries) in the following format:

```python

{
    "chat": 1,
    "turn": 1,
    "author": "carl",
    "utterance": "I need to take my pills, but I cannot find them.",
    "utterance_type": UtteranceType.STATEMENT,
    "position": "0-25",
    "subject": {"label": "carl", "type": "person"},
    "predicate": {"type": "see"},
    "object": {"label": "pills", "type": "object"},
    "perspective": {"certainty": 1, "polarity": -1, "sentiment": -1},
    "context_id": 123,
    "date": date(2021, 3, 12),
    "place": "Carl's room",
    "place_id": 12,
    "country": "Netherlands",
    "region": "North Holland",
    "city": "Amsterdam",
    "objects": [{'type': 'chair', 'confidence': 0.68, 'id': 1},
                {'type': 'table', 'confidence': 0.79, 'id': 1}],
    "people": [{'name': 'Carl', 'confidence': 0.94, 'id': 1}]
}

```

Please ensure that the capsules to feed into the ``LongTermMemory`` object are well formed. When a field is not known
you may use an empty string (``""``) or ``None``.

### Logs

Please that note that initializing the ``LongTermMemory`` object requires a directory where to save the logging
information. By default the example scripts will use a temporary directory to store the logs, which will be cleaned
up after running the script. If you want to retain the logs you can specify a log folder with the `--logs` parameter
in each example script, e.g.

```shell
> python carl.py --logs my_log_dir
```

Every time a ``LongTermMemory`` object is initialized, a folder in the logs directory is created using the the current
timestamp. Every time information comes into the brain (e.g. every time a capsule is processed) a new ``.trig`` file is
created with a snapshot of the RDF triples created from the processing.
